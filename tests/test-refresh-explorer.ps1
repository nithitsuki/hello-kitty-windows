# Regression test: the shell-refresh machinery must NEVER kill explorer.
# Live checks (run in the interactive session):
#   1. Update-PerUserSettings / Restart-StartMenuHost must not kill explorer
#      (same PID before and after).
#   2. Refresh-Shell (the function apply/restore call) must NOT restart or kill
#      explorer at all - the theme is applied via a live broadcast. Killing the
#      shell is what triggered the recurring explorer.exe crash on this machine.
#   3. Restart-ExplorerSafe (the opt-in hard restart) must still RECOVER from a
#      dead explorer and leave it running and stable seconds later.
#
# RED first: Refresh-Shell still force-kills explorer, so step 2 fails.
